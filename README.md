### 👀 🖖🏻 Hello!

I'm Richie, a Swiss-Mexican techie rooted in Zurich and nurtured globally. My journey began in French-speaking Switzerland (Geneva) and spanned across Malaysia, Mexico, and Ireland, giving me a unique multicultural perspective. My professional trajectory took off at IBM in 2008, and since then, I've ventured through startups and global giants, specializing in e-commerce, fintech, and IT.

Since 2013, my expertise has been anchored in the payment industry. I now drive innovation at Datatrans, a leading payment service provider and a proud member of the Planet family. My role as a Product Manager centers around product design, management, and sharpening our UX/UI. At Datatrans, we are reshaping the online payment landscape with innovative offerings in mobile payments, tokenization products, marketplace solutions, and more.

If you need any advice or got a question, send me a message! I'm pretty fast at replying.

Companies I worked at: Datatrans (part of Planet), Planet, Wallee (previously Customweb), IBM, Sonect, and more.

Things I love: Gaming, photography, cinema, mechanical keyboards, interior design, the Rubik's cube, squash, cooking, coffee, and plants.
