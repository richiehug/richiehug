### 👀 🖖🏻 Hello!

My name is Richie, and I'm a Swiss-Mexican techie from Zurich, Switzerland. I was raised in Geneva and had been living in Malaysia, Mexico, and Ireland as well. I started working in 2008 at IBM and continued my path with different positions at startup and multinational companies, mainly focusing on the e-commerce, fintech, and IT industry. I've been working in the payment industry since 2013.

Datatrans is a leading payment service provider in Europe and provides payment solutions for online payments. We offer subscription payments, tokenization of payment information, seamless mobile payments, marketplace solutions, and more.

If you need any advice or got a question, send me a message! I'm pretty fast at replying.
