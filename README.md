### 👀 🖖🏻 Hello!

Hi there! I'm Richie, a Swiss-Mexican product leader based in Zurich with a passion for turning complexity into clarity. My journey started in French-speaking Switzerland and led me through Malaysia, Mexico, and Ireland—each stop shaping how I think about people, technology, and design.

Since 2013, I've dedicated my career to the payments industry, building products that move money seamlessly and securely across borders. Today, as Head of Product at Nexi Switzerland, I'm focused on shaping the next chapter of digital payments.

If you need any advice or got a question, send me a message! I'm pretty fast at replying.

Companies I worked at: Datatrans (part of Planet), Planet, Wallee (previously Customweb), IBM, Sonect, and more.

Things I love: Gaming, photography, cinema, mechanical keyboards, interior design, the Rubik's cube, squash, cooking, coffee, and plants.
